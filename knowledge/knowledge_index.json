Upon receipt of the program prepared by the Using Agency, the Commission shall decide if the town should hire a consultant for the work described in Step 2.

On the basis of the consultant's report, the Using Agency may request that the town meeting appropriate funds necessary to compensate the consultant for the second phase under the consultant's contract. Alternatively, the Commission or the Using Agency may recommend that the contract be terminated and that a new consultant be appointed to carry the work forward.

Valuing diversity and inclusion in and for the Brookline community, the Commission, in coordination with the Office, aims to support a welcoming environment by encouraging cooperation, tolerance, and respect among and by all persons who come in contact with the Town of Brookline (\u201cTown\u201d), including",
      "Community Relations (\u201cOffice\u201d or \u201cODICR\u201d). Valuing diversity and inclusion in and for the Brookline community, the Commission, in coordination with the Office, aims to support a welcoming environment by encouraging cooperation, tolerance, and respect among and by all persons who come in contact with the Town of Brookline (\u201cTown\u201d), including residents, visitors, persons passing through the Town, employers, employees, and job applicants, and by advancing, promoting and advocating for the human and civil rights of all through education, awareness, outreach and advocacy. The Purpose of the Commission and the goal of the Town shall be to strive for a community characterized by the values of inclusion. The Town believes that inclusion will provide opportunities and incentives to all who touch Brookline to offer their energy, creativity, knowledge, and experiences to the community and to all civic engagements, including town government; and that inclusion is, therefore, a critically important government interest of the Town. Inclusion is defined as actively pursuing goals of including, integrating, engaging, and welcoming into the community all persons who come in contact with the Town regardless of their race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, age, religion, creed, ancestry, national origin, military or veteran status, genetic information, marital status, receipt of public benefits (including housing subsidies), or family status (e.g. because one has or doesn't have children) (herein, \u201cBrookline Protected Classes\u201d). In striving to achieve the goal of inclusion, the Commission shall be guided by the following general principles: (1) the foundation of community is strong and positive community relations among and between all groups and individuals in the community, regardless of their membership in a Brookline Protected Class; (2) the substance of community is the recognition of human rights principles as applicable to all persons who come in contact with the Town; (3) justice in a community requires, at a minimum, monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws as they apply to all persons who come in contact with the Town; and (4) the commitment of the Town to these principles requires vigorous affirmative steps to carry out the word and spirit of the foregoing. The Commission shall consist of fifteen (15) residents, who shall be called Commissioners. Commissioners shall be appointed by the Select Board and shall hold office for a period of not more than three (3) years with terms of office expiring on August 31 of an appropriate year in a staggered manner so that approximately one-third (1/3) of the terms of the Commissioners will expire each year.
